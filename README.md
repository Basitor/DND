# DND
Database for Dungeons and Dragons

Right now there is only database for selecting / observing and configuring the items

This DB is using the SQLite library, UI is made by PyQt5

This is my first big software, so I'm open for any comments

***
To start using this software:
1. Install all libraries:
 - PyQt5
 - sqlite3 (should be installed on default)
2. Launch "Creating_a_DB.py" - This will create a database for using
3. You can add items using "Items_change.py"
4. You can wiew the items using "Whole_items.py" or "Hero_items.py"
